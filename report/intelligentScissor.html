<H1>Intelligent Scissor</H1>
<p>Base on <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/02wi/readings/mort-sigg95.pdf">Sigg95 paper</a> .</p>

<H2>UI control</H2>
<ul>
  <li>"Folder" icon to open and operate on an image.</li>
  <li>First "save" icon to save image with contour.</li>
  <li>Second "save" icon to save the mask generated by the selected contour.</li>
  <li>Third "save" icon to save the area of image cut by the selected contour.</li>
  <li>Image can be zoomed in and out and move around.</li>
  <li>Image has two view mode: original and gradient map.</li><br>
  <li>To start a new path, press "Put A Seed". Left click to create new seeds, "Delete" to undo previous seed. 
  	<br>Press "Enter" to end the contour, or double click to close the contour.</li>
  <li>One can hide or show contours as wish.</li>
  <li>To select a particular contour in order to delete it or save the mask, press "Select A Contour".<br>
  	Selected contour will show a different color. After selection, press "Delete" to delete it.</li>
  <li>Debug Mode: <br>
  	<I>Pixel Node</I>:  A cost graph with original image pixel colors at the center of each 3by3 window, and black everywhere else.<br>
	<I>Cost Graph</I>: A cost graph with both pixel colors and link costs. Low cost (darker) for links along image edges.<br>
	<I>Path Tree</I>: See the live expansion of minimum path tree.<br>
	<I>Min Path</I>: Show the minimum path between the current seed and the mouse position.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Implementation</H2>
<ul>
	<li> Basic steps: <br>i. Use 8 kernels to apply on each pixel of the image to get a cost matrix (x*y*8 size) <br>ii. Do a shortest path search using Dijkstra's algorithm. Insertion and extractMin using priority queue.</li>
	<li> Add a Guassian filter before calculating the image cost matrix. <br>==> Resulting in better adherence at strong edges, but sometimes ignores small (but not is not noise!) disturbances.</li>
	<li> Tried both cost functions given on course webpage and the paper. In my case, the paper one performs better.</li>
	<li>  Seed snapping: seed is automatically moved to the closest edge. (search radius 5) 
		<br> (Sometimes may cause undesired result but overall performs well.)</li>
